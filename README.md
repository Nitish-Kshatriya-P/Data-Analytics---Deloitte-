In the virtual internship from Deloitte Australia provided by Forage platform, we had to create a dashboard representing the unhealthy machines that had taken a minimum of 10 minutes for functioning again. So I created a new column that had values 10 for rows that had column value to be 'unhealthy' and 0 for 'healthy'. 

Then plotted 2 charts to show the number of unhealthy machines in each factory at different locations. Added a filter for seeing how many unhealthy machines were present for each department of the facility at each location.

And the task 2 comprised of generating categorical values based on a numeric column in an excel file using the nested IF()  statements.
